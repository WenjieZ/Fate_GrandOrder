# Fate / Grand Order
This repo helps you to visualize the stats curves of spirits.

An example can be viewed [here](https://gist.github.com/WenjieZ/d699211f31579af2644f7212619c4741).
The x-axis is the 4-star exp card needed.

You can edit the ipython notebook to custermize the figure.

Currently, it contains only the data of 60+ spirits. Feel free to open a pull request to add more data.
If I get 100 stars or forks, I will also consider add them myself as well as other features.
